This application is a simple spring boot vs jsp project 
that shows counter of users on the current page
Run as regular spring boot project.
To test functionality use several browser clients,
go to http://localhost:8080/,
then go to http://localhost:8080/counter, 
and again to http://localhost:8080/,
track count of users while switching between pages,
have fun :)
